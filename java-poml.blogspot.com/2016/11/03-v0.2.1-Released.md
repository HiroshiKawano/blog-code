Hello!  
It's a sunny day, in Tokyo Japan.

Today, [POML v0.2.1](https://github.com/mamorum/poml/releases/tag/v0.2.1) is out.  
So, let me introduce one of the changes.

From this version, POML supports "No Layout Section".  
Previous POML has to contain "Layout Section" in it's file.

    pkg=com.example:demo:0.0.1:jar
    depends=
      junit:junit:4.12:test,
      org.assertj:assertj-core:3.2.0:test
    property=project.build.sourceEncoding:UTF-8
    ---
    {{#model4 }}
      {{pkg }}
      {{depends }}
      {{property}}
    {{/model4}}

But now, POML is able to generate `pom.xml` from bellow.

    pkg=com.example:demo:0.0.1:jar
    depends=
      junit:junit:4.12:test,
      org.assertj:assertj-core:3.2.0:test
    property=project.build.sourceEncoding:UTF-8

If POML File contains only "Config Section",  
POML determines XML layout automatically.

Of course, we can use "Layout Section",  
to generate a `pom.xml` as before.

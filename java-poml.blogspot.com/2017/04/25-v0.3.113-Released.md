Hello.

[POML v0.3.113](https://github.com/mamorum/poml/releases/tag/v0.3.113) was out.

This version has big update, like following.

- Change syntax
- Rename some config keys (ex. property -> properties)
- Delete some config keys (ex. depends, sbp, ...)
- etc

And I reduced documents for maintenace.  
When the POML is stable,  I'd like to write more documents.

Thanks for reading.

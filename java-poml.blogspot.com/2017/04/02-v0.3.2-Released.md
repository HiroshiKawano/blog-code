Hello.

[POML v0.3.2](https://github.com/mamorum/poml/releases/tag/v0.3.2) was out.

This version deletes config keys "compiler" and "exec".   
Let me explain the reasons why I deleted them.


#### compiler
We can configure compiler versions (source, target) as maven properties, like following.

##### pom.poml

```
property=$compiler:1.8
```

##### pom.xml

```
  <properties>
    <maven.compiler.source>1.8</maven.compiler.source>
    <maven.compiler.target>1.8</maven.compiler.target>
  </properties>
```


#### exec
I realized that the maven goal `exec:java` is executable from command line, if there is no `exec-maven-plugin` in the `pom.xml`, like following.

```
> mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=poml.Main -Dexec.args="pom.poml pom.xml"
```


Thanks for reading.

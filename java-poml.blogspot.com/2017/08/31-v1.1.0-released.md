Hello.

[Poml v1.1.0](https://github.com/mamorum/poml/releases/tag/v1.1.0) was out.

In this version, config `build.base` is added.

```
build.base=defaultGoal>test, finalName>demo
---
  <build>
    {{build.base}}
  </build>
```

Above converted to 

```
  <build>
    <defaultGoal>test</defaultGoal>
    <finalName>demo</finalName>
  </build>
```

And `poml` command has some changes.  
All changes are listed on [Changelog](https://github.com/mamorum/poml/releases/tag/v1.1.0).


Thanks for reading.

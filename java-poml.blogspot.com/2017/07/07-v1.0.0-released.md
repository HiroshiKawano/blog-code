Hello.

[POML v1.0.0](https://github.com/mamorum/poml/releases/tag/v1.0.0) was out.

In this version, `relativePath` is added to `parent`.

```
parent=com.example:demo-parent:0.0.1:../pom.xml
```

Above converted to 

```
 <parent>
  <groupId>com.example</groupId>
  <artifactId>demo-parent</artifactId>
  <version>0.0.1</version>
  <relativePath>../pom.xml</relativePath>
</parent>
```

And now Poml becomes `1.0.0`.  
I'd like to continue updating.

Thanks for reading.
